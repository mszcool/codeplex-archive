<p>As documented on the main landing page for the project, GeRes2 has several components that do interact with each other through different Azure platform services. You need to create those platform services components in Azure and then configure access to
 those in the GeRes2 configuration files.</p>
<h3>Pre-Requisites for Development</h3>
<p>When developing for and with GeRes2, you’ll need the following components installed on your machine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2013 Professional or higher
<ul>
<li>Update 1 recommended but not required</li></ul>
</li><li>NuGet package manager Extension installed in Visual Studio </li><li>Microsoft Azure SDK 2.2 or higher
<ul>
<li>Azure Emulator is required for local debugging</li></ul>
</li><li>SQL Server Express 2008 or higher </li><li>A Microsoft Azure subscription
<ul>
<li>Also required for local debugging since GeRes2 has a dependency on Service Bus and does not work with Service Bus for Windows Server, yet.
</li><li>We are planning to make GeRes2 compatible with the Azure Pack for Windows Server which is currently using older APIs as compared to Microsoft Azure in the public cloud depending on the release cycles and road map of the Azure pack for Windows Server.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<h3>Dependencies on Azure Platform Services &amp; Components</h3>
<p>In summary, the Microsoft Azure platform services leveraged and required by GeRes2 are:</p>

<p>For setting up an environment, whether it’s test or production, this means you need to first<strong> create storage accounts and a service bus namespace</strong> as well as configure your Azure Active Directory that can be used by GeRes2. We prepared GeRes2
 to support the following setup which is also the recommendation for production environments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary storage account: used for everything except Windows Azure Diagnostics and the table SLABLogsTable.
</li><li>Log storage account: used for Windows Azure Diagnostics and the aforementioned SLABLogsTable as listed above.
</li><li>One Service Bus namespace: used for all topics/subscriptions described above.
</li><li>One Azure Active Directory: used for authorizing calls against the GeRes2 JobHub.
<ul>
<li>You need to register your GeRes2 JobHub as a WebAPI. </li><li>You need to register at least one client with a secret key used for authentication against Azure AD.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>If you intend to use GeRes2 for learning or development &amp; test environments, combining the Primary storage account and the Log storage account into a single storage account is perfectly fine. For production environments we nevertheless recommend keeping
 those separate so that the load of logging does only have a minimal impact on your execution performance.</p>
